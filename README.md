# Why this doc?

We are researchers and engineers in AI (very vague term but oh well ...) who
have managed to get access to Jean Zay and think this can be a very useful
cluster for your AI research.

At the time of writing (end November 2020), the GPU part of Jean Zay is still
underused and we think a user-contributed documentation could help people
navigating the access procedure and knowing a few necessary tips and tricks to
be productive on such a cluster.

**This is a collaborative doc, if you spot errors or things that
could be improved, open an
[issue](https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc/issues/new) or even
better a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc/compare)!**

We use gitter for chat, don't hesitate to get involved
